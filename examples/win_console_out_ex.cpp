// An example of how we're using the ConvertOutput() function to output_iterator
// non-ASCII characters on a Windows console.

// By including the header like this, you'll be using explicit instantiation.
// You'll need to add win_console_out_inst.cpp to your build, or you won't be
// able to build this example, due to undefined symbols.
// Here's a brief overview of the way the code's organized:

// http://cidebycide.blogspot.pt/2016/02/explicit-template-instantiation-exhibit.html
//
// If you prefer to avoid explicit instantiation, uncomment this line:
// #define PCBLUESY_MSWINDCON_FULLHEADER
#include "ms_windows/win_console_out.h"
